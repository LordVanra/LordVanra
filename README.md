# LordVanra

Hi, I’m **Arnav Prabhudesai**. I am a student developer with a strong interest in software engineering, computational mathematics, simulations, and competitive robotics. I’ve worked extensively with FTC and FRC robotics, taught programming and electronics, and enjoy building projects that combine math, physics, and code.

I’m currently a student at **Mass Academy.**
